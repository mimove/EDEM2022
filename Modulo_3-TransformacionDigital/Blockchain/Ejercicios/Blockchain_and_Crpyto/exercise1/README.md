# Exercise 1: Setting up an Avalanche wallet

In this exercise we will be creating an Avalanche wallet which will be running in your browser. With it you will be able to manage it, sign transactions, send and recieve ether, manage tokens, etc.

NOTE: For obvious reasons, in this exercise we will be using an Avalanche testnet [FUJI](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/) and not the mainnet.

## Instructions

We will be using [**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/) to create a Wallet and connect to Avalanche blockchain:

* **Pre-requisite**: Google Chrome or Firefox installed
* Go to MetaMask site: https://metamask.io/download.html
* Install the Chrome extension
* Create a new wallet by clicking on the MetaMask icon (a fox on the top right hand of your browser)
  * You will be asked to note down some words. There are your recovery words in case you lose your wallet.
* Add the “Avalanche Fuji Testnet” setting up in Metamask the configuration on https://docs.avax.network/quickstart/fuji-workflow
* Follow the steps in “Fuji’s faucet” in order to get some Avax:
  * https://faucet.avax.network/
  * **TIP**: If you don’t have Twitter or Facebook, feel free to ask the teacher for some Ether
* Send some Avax to your colleagues!!!
