# Exercise 4: Adding tokens to your wallet

In this exercise you will be adding ERC-20 tokens to your MetaMask wallet.

We will be using two different ones:

* **Tether USD**: A very famous stablecoin linked to the US dollar
* **GFT Test Token**: A simple custo token created by GFT for testing purposes
  * More info here: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x09da9b7a133057e4df17c503cf4589bc096da964

## Instructions

If you open MetaMask you will currently only see the amount of Ether that you have, but the wallet is also able to track ERC-20 tokens.
Let's add some GFT Test Tokens":

* Open MetaMask
* Click on "Add token" (or "Agregar token" in Spanish)
* Look for USDT (ticker for Tehter USD) and click "Next"

Now you know how many USDT you have. That is... 0!!

We are now going to add some custom tokens with which we can play around:

* Open MetaMask
* Click on "Add token" (or "Agregar token" in Spanish)
* Change to the "Personalized token" tab and add the following token address: **0x09da9b7a133057e4df17c503cf4589bc096da964**
* This will add the rest of the info and you can click on "Next"
