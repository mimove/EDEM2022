# Apache Kafka

## Development Environment Installation
Dear student, to maximize the productivity of the Kafka Training sessions we request you to install **prior** the sessions the necessary tools in your local environment (pc or laptop). In case of technical issues the teacher will try to assist you during these sessions. Thank you.

### IDE tool to develop in Java language the Kafka applications
* Follow this [link]( https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) to install **IntelliJ Idea**. Choose the right version depending on your operative system (Windows, Mac or Linux), and then choose the **Community** free of charge edition.

### Get source code exercises
You can just directly download the zip file and unzip it: https://github.com/rusansor/edem2021/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

## Ensure Kafka runs OK in your local environment
* Follow/execute this [Kafka steps](https://github.com/rusansor/edem2021/tree/main/1-Kakfa-Producer-Consumer-API/Exercises/Class), just until the second console command "docker-compose ps", to validate that your Kafka is up and running OK. At this moment you do not need to understand the steps, they will be covered in theory&practice during the training sessions.

Thank you :) for having tried to follow above steps!!!!
